# Details about AWS Services used
# Region Specification:
The Region is kept as us-east-1 as it is considered as the main region. Moreover, it is the largest AWS region with maximum service availability. Also, the services we plan to use for this project are fully supported by us-east-1 region. Also, we are using third-party API (World Bank and Non-profit Orgnazations for Charity/ Donation). These APIs are often hosted in US and EU regions. Thus, the latency will be low when Lambda call for this APIs.
